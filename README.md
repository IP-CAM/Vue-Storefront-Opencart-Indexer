**To be used with the [Vue Storefront Connector Extension for OpenCart](https://github.com/butopea/vue-storefront-opencart-vsbridge).**

This script will import your data from OpenCart into Vue Storefront (ElasticSearch) via the VS Bridge extension.

**Installation:**

* Clone this repository
* Edit `config.json` to set your VS Bridge credentials, ElasticSearch index name, store ID, language ID, as well as endpoint URLs to match your domain. 

Note: You need to whitelist your IP address in OpenCart's admin panel.

**Usage:**

* Go to the `src` folder and execute `./run.sh`

**Development:**

We're currently in the early stages of getting all the features working and would love other OpenCart developers to join in with us on this project!
